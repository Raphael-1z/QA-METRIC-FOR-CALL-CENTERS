Call Center QA Metrics  

Overview  
This project contains a **Quality Assurance (QA) evaluation framework** I developed for a collections call center. The framework provides a structured way to measure agent performance, ensuring compliance, professionalism, and effective customer interactions.  

Purpose  
- Establish a consistent and measurable evaluation process.  
- Highlight top-performing agents and identify areas for improvement.  
- Improve customer experience through actionable feedback.  
- Support compliance with organizational and regulatory standards.  

Metrics Covered  
The QA framework evaluates agents on:  
- Call Adherence & Compliance  
- Communication Skills & Clarity  
- Agent Politeness & Professionalism  
- Script Adherence & Identity Verification  
- Empathy & Active Listening  
- Non-Confrontational Approach  
- Negotiation & Payment Education  
- Call Resolution Time  

Each factor contributes to an overall performance score, enabling trend analysis and targeted coaching.
